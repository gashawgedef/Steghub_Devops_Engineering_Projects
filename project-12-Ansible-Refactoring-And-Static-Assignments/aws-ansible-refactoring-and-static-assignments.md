# ANSIBLE REFACTORING AND STATIC ASSIGNMENTS (IMPORTS AND ROLES)

In this project we will continue working with ansible-config-mgt repository and make some improvements of our code. Now we need 
to refactor our Ansible code, `create assignments`, and learn how to use the `imports functionality`. Imports allow to effectively `re-use` 
previously created playbooks in a new playbook – it allows you to organize your tasks and reuse them when needed.

[Refactoring] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) is a general term in computer programming. It means making changes to the source code without changing expected behaviour of the software. The main idea of refactoring is to enhance code readability, increase maintainability and extensibility, reduce complexity, add proper comments without affecting the logic.


In our case, we will move things around a little bit in the code, but the overal state of the infrastructure remains the same.

**Let us see how we can improve our Ansible code!**

# Step 1 - Jenkins job enhancement

Before we begin, let us make some changes to our Jenkins job – now every new change in the codes creates a separate directory which is not very convenient when we want to run some commands from one place. Besides, it consumes space on Jenkins serves with each subsequent change. Let us enhance it by introducing a new Jenkins **project/job** – we will require [Copy Artifact](https://plugins.jenkins.io/copyartifact/ ) plugin.

1. Go to your `Jenkins-Ansible server` and create a new directory called ansible-config-artifact – we will store there all artifacts 
after each build.

```
sudo mkdir /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact
```

2. Change permissions to this directory, so Jenkins could save files there 

```
chmod -R 0777 /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact
```

3. Go to Jenkins web console -> Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins -> on Available tab search for Copy Artifact and install this plugin without restarting Jenkins

**Use existing  git** 

![image](https://github.com/melkamu372/StegHub-DevOps-Cloud-Engineering/assets/47281626/cded1168-dd5b-4a15-8fac-c1852a3ebfb6)

**Add github hook trigger**

**Add post build action** 
![image](https://github.com/melkamu372/StegHub-DevOps-Cloud-Engineering/assets/47281626/8d20c836-2f52-489f-83ec-466138c455a3)


4. Create a new Freestyle project (you have done it in **Project 9**) and name it `save_artifacts`
![image](https://github.com/melkamu372/StegHub-DevOps-Cloud-Engineering/assets/47281626/e9f42da4-42eb-4dfc-b29f-7d478af02934)

5. This project will be triggered by completion of your existing ansible project. Configure it accordingly:

![image](https://github.com/melkamu372/StegHub-DevOps-Cloud-Engineering/assets/47281626/2e163086-2dd5-4f68-892a-245cf510ad6f)

![image](https://github.com/melkamu372/StegHub-DevOps-Cloud-Engineering/assets/47281626/38aee6b8-021d-4d5c-822b-17e7b3384996)


> Note: You can configure number of builds to keep in order to save space on the server, for example, you might want to keep only last
2 or 5 build results. You can also make this change to your ansible job.

6. The main idea of `save_artifacts` project is to save artifacts into `/home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact` directory. To achieve this, create a Build step and choose Copy artifacts from other project, specify ansible as a source project and 
`/home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact` as a target directory.


![image](https://github.com/melkamu372/StegHub-DevOps-Cloud-Engineering/assets/47281626/e88ec480-3ad9-4912-a59c-d5a27b1f044e)

> if you get an error Replace `/home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact` with `${WORKSPACE}/ansible-config-artifact`

7. Test your set up by making some change in `README.MD` file inside your `ansible-config-mgt` repository (right inside master branch).

![image](https://github.com/melkamu372/StegHub-DevOps-Cloud-Engineering/assets/47281626/aad9f5f8-1758-44f7-8a5a-3cc496da9455)


If both Jenkins jobs have completed one after another – you shall see your files inside /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact directory and it will be updated with every commit to your master branch.

Now your Jenkins pipeline is more neat and clean.

# Step 2 - Refactor Ansible code by importing other playbooks into site.yml

Before starting to refactor the codes, ensure that you have pulled down the latest code from master (main) branch, and created a new branch, name it refactor.

DevOps philosophy implies constant iterative improvement for better efficiency – refactoring is one of the techniques that can be used, but you always have an answer to question "why?". Why do we need to change something if it works well?


**In Project 11** you wrote all tasks in a single playbook `common.yml`, now it is pretty simple set of instructions for only 2 types of OS, but imagine you have many more tasks and you need to apply this playbook to other servers with different requirements. In this case, you will have to read through the whole playbook to check if all tasks written there are applicable and is there anything that you 
need to add for certain server/OS families. Very fast it will become a tedious exercise and your playbook will become messy with many commented parts. Your DevOps colleagues will not appreciate such organization of your codes and it will be difficult for them to use your playbook.


Most Ansible users learn the one-file approach first. However, breaking tasks up into different files is an excellent way to organize complex sets of tasks and reuse them.

Let see code re-use in action by importing other playbooks.


1. Within playbooks folder, create a new file and name it `site.yml` - This file will now be considered as an entry point into the entire infrastructure configuration. 

Other playbooks will be included here as a reference. In other words, `site.yml` will become a parent to all other playbooks that will be developed. Including `common.yml` that you created previously. Dont worry, you will understand more what this means shortly.

2. Create a new folder in root of the repository and name it `static-assignments`. The static-assignments folder is where all other children playbooks will be stored. This is merely for easy organization of your work. It is not an Ansible specific concept, therefore you can choose how you want to organize your work. You will see why the folder name has a prefix of static very soon. For now, just
follow along.

3. Move `common.yml` file into the newly created static-assignments folder.

4. Inside `site.yml` file, `import common.yml` playbook.

```
---
- hosts: all
- import_playbook: ../static-assignments/common.yml
```

The code above uses built in import_playbook Ansible module.

[ansible.builtin.import_playbook module – Import a playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/import_playbook_module.html)

Your folder structure should look like this;

```
├── static-assignments
│   └── common.yml
├── inventory
    └── dev
    └── stage
    └── uat
    └── prod
└── playbooks
    └── site.yml
```

![image](https://github.com/melkamu372/StegHub-DevOps-Cloud-Engineering/assets/47281626/fbbf0f46-7aa7-4f30-9089-8f10df19b2e8)


5. Run ansible-playbook command against the dev environment Since you need to apply some tasks to your **dev servers** and **wireshark** is already installed - you can go ahead and create another playbook under static-assignments and name it `common-del.yml`. In this playbook, configure deletion of wireshark utility.


```
---
- name: update web, nfs and db servers
  hosts: webservers, nfs, db
  remote_user: ec2-user
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
  - name: delete wireshark
    yum:
      name: wireshark
      state: removed

- name: update LB server
  hosts: lb
  remote_user: ubuntu
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
  - name: delete wireshark
    apt:
      name: wireshark-qt
      state: absent
      autoremove: yes
      purge: yes
      autoclean: yes
```

update `site.yml` with - import_playbook: ../static-assignments/common-del.yml instead of common.yml and run it against dev servers:

```
cd /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/
```

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory/dev.yml playbooks/site.yaml
```
![image](https://github.com/melkamu372/StegHub-DevOps-Cloud-Engineering/assets/47281626/ed6ce588-9909-4883-9ea9-67078ff12a70)


![image](https://github.com/melkamu372/StegHub-DevOps-Cloud-Engineering/assets/47281626/629ac5ba-ccac-45fb-b4b9-cab4d3768006)

Make sure that wireshark is deleted on all the servers by running 

```
wireshark --version
```
![image](https://github.com/melkamu372/StegHub-DevOps-Cloud-Engineering/assets/47281626/19a8432a-9e52-47b0-b390-e01df89c0a57)

![image](https://github.com/melkamu372/StegHub-DevOps-Cloud-Engineering/assets/47281626/633fffe6-53f8-43be-85d7-f6c3cd15bd0b)


Now you have learned how to use `import_playbooks` module and you have a ready solution to `install/delete` packages on multiple servers with just one command

# Step 3 – Configure UAT Webservers with a role `Webserver`

We have our nice and clean dev environment, so let us put it aside and configure 2 new Web Servers as uat. We could write tasks to configure `Web Servers` in the same playbook, but it would be too messy, instead, we will use a dedicated role to make our configuration reusable.


1. Launch 2 fresh EC2 instances using RHEL 8 image, we will use them as our uat servers, so give them names accordingly - **Web1-UAT** and **Web2-UAT**

 **Web1-UAT**
![image](https://github.com/melkamu372/StegHub-DevOps-Cloud-Engineering/assets/47281626/2d9fd243-6e00-43c1-8d1e-8a192f0d639a)

**Web2-UAT**
![image](https://github.com/melkamu372/StegHub-DevOps-Cloud-Engineering/assets/47281626/cf96e371-3645-4aa5-84e3-77685b38f0d9)

> Tip: Do not forget to stop EC2 instances that you are not using at the moment to avoid paying extra. For now, you only need **2** new 
**RHEL 8 servers as Web Servers** and 1 existing **Jenkins-Ansible** server up and running.

2. To create a role, you must create a directory called roles/, relative to the playbook file or in `/etc/ansible/` directory.

There are two ways how you can create this folder structure:

- Use an Ansible utility called `ansible-galaxy` inside ansible-config-mgt/roles directory (you need to create roles directory upfront)

```
mkdir roles
```
```
cd roles
```
```
ansible-galaxy init webserver
```
![image](https://github.com/melkamu372/StegHub-DevOps-Cloud-Engineering/assets/47281626/b69783ac-920e-4ccd-aaea-ab934f7f6ede)


3. Create the directory/files structure manually

> Note: You can choose either way, but since you store all your codes in GitHub, it is recommended to create folders and files there rather than locally on Jenkins-Ansible server.


The entire folder structure should look like below, but if you create it manually – you can skip creating tests, files, and vars or remove them if you used ansible-galaxy

```
└── webserver
    ├── README.md
    ├── defaults
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── files
    ├── handlers
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── meta
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── tasks
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── templates
    ├── tests
    │   ├── inventory
    │   └── test.yml
    └── vars
        └── main.yml
```

![image](https://github.com/melkamu372/StegHub-DevOps-Cloud-Engineering/assets/47281626/ba794c97-88aa-4822-9340-e3d04e800e1b)


After removing unnecessary directories and files, the roles structure should look like this


```
└── webserver
    ├── README.md
    ├── defaults
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── handlers
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── meta
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── tasks
    │   └── main.yml
    └── templates
```

3. Update your inventory `ansible-config-mgt/inventory/uat.yml` file with IP addresses of your 2 UAT Web servers

> NOTE: Ensure you are using `ssh-agent` to ssh into the Jenkins-Ansible instance just as you have done in project 11;


To learn how to setup SSH agent and connect VS Code to your Jenkins-Ansible instance, please see this video:

```
[uat-webservers]
<Web1-UAT-Server-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user' 

<Web2-UAT-Server-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user' 
```

```
[uat-webservers]
172.31.29.247 ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user' 

172.31.20.250 ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user' 
```
![image](https://github.com/melkamu372/StegHub-DevOps-Cloud-Engineering/assets/47281626/fd6c7acf-fa57-481a-94a6-11ccb4cb0bbc)


4. In /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg file uncomment roles_path string and provide a full path to your roles directory 

```
roles_path = /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/roles
```
!:[image](https://github.com/melkamu372/StegHub-DevOps-Cloud-Engineering/assets/47281626/1f31a06b-1fc1-42d6-91d1-d71b0f7ac405)

so Ansible could know where to find configured roles.

5. It is time to start adding some logic to the webserver role. Go into tasks directory, and within the `main.yml` file, start writing
 configuration tasks to do the following:
 
- Install and configure Apache (httpd service)
- Clone Tooling website from GitHub https://github.com/<your-name>/tooling.git.
- Ensure the tooling website code is deployed to /var/www/html on each of 2 UAT Web servers.
- Make sure httpd service is started
  
  
Your `main.yml` may consist of following tasks:

```
---
- name: install apache
  become: true
  ansible.builtin.yum:
    name: "httpd"
    state: present

- name: install git
  become: true
  ansible.builtin.yum:
    name: "git"
    state: present

- name: clone a repo
  become: true
  ansible.builtin.git:
    repo: https://github.com/<your-name>/tooling.git
    dest: /var/www/html
    force: yes

- name: copy html content to one level up
  become: true
  command: cp -r /var/www/html/html/ /var/www/

- name: Start service httpd, if not started
  become: true
  ansible.builtin.service:
    name: httpd
    state: started

- name: recursively remove /var/www/html/html/ directory
  become: true
  ansible.builtin.file:
    path: /var/www/html/html
    state: absent
```

# Step 4 – Reference `Webserver` role

Within the `static-assignments` folder, create a new assignment for `uat-webservers` uat-webservers.yml. This is where you will reference the role.

```
---
- hosts: uat-webservers
  roles:
     - webserver
```
![image](https://github.com/melkamu372/StegHub-DevOps-Cloud-Engineering/assets/47281626/25b29c07-9724-4b46-8cd3-ee50505db775)


> Remember that the entry point to our ansible configuration is the `site.yml` file. Therefore, you need to refer your `uat-webservers.yml` role inside `site.yml`

So, we should have this in site.yml


```
---
- hosts: all
- import_playbook: ../static-assignments/common.yml

- hosts: uat-webservers
- import_playbook: ../static-assignments/uat-webservers.yml
```
![image](https://github.com/melkamu372/StegHub-DevOps-Cloud-Engineering/assets/47281626/2b70f029-9b4f-4009-85b9-f8feecabca4e)

# Step 5 – Commit & Test

Commit your changes, create a **Pull Request** and merge them to master branch, make sure webhook triggered two consequent Jenkins jobs,
they ran successfully and copied all the files to your Jenkins-Ansible server into
`/home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/` directory

![image](https://github.com/melkamu372/StegHub-DevOps-Cloud-Engineering/assets/47281626/9ff74441-e0a9-4b34-adc4-2154313d1076)

```
ls /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/
```
![image](https://github.com/melkamu372/StegHub-DevOps-Cloud-Engineering/assets/47281626/4c3ab445-5509-487e-9e81-a14723eb46bb)

Now run the playbook against your `uat` inventory and see what happens:

```
sudo ansible-playbook -i /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/inventory/uat.yml /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/playbooks/site.yaml
```
![image](https://github.com/melkamu372/StegHub-DevOps-Cloud-Engineering/assets/47281626/fc29898e-8e61-4f24-aa78-72e5444a7df3)

![image](https://github.com/melkamu372/StegHub-DevOps-Cloud-Engineering/assets/47281626/e93ea4be-fafe-42a4-8f6a-9e52c0021bc7)


You should be able to see both of your **UAT Web servers** configured and you can try to reach them from your browser:

http://<Web1-UAT-Server-Public-IP-or-Public-DNS-Name>/index.php

or

http://<Web1-UAT-Server-Public-IP-or-Public-DNS-Name>/index.php



Your Ansible architecture now looks like this:
  
  
![6043](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85270361/210155433-92f8eac4-d31f-4cbe-af16-16dd70b2a498.PNG)

  
In Project 13, you will see the difference between Static and Dynamic assignments.

### The End of Project 12 
We deploy and configure `UAT Web Servers` using Ansible imports and roles!
