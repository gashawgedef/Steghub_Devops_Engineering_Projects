# Self Study Journey: Developing a MERN Stack Application in AWS
## 1. Self Study Journey

**Overview**

In my pursuit of mastering full-stack development, I chose to build a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application deployed on AWS. This project was an opportunity to combine frontend and backend technologies with cloud deployment. By building this app, I aimed to enhance my proficiency in both MERN stack development and cloud services like AWS.

## Steps I Followed:

**Learning the MERN Stack:**

I started by learning the individual technologies in the MERN stack. I took several courses and worked on small projects using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js to gain practical experience.

**Building the Application:**

I designed and built a full-stack application. The backend was developed using Node.js with Express, and the frontend was built using React. MongoDB was used for database management.

**Deploying on AWS:**

I familiarized myself with AWS services such as EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), S3 (Simple Storage Service), and RDS (Relational Database Service) to host the application.
I used EC2 to host my server-side code and deployed my frontend via S3. I also explored AWS Elastic Beanstalk for deployment automation.
