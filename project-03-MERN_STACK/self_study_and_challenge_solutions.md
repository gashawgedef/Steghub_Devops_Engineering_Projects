# Self Study Journey: Developing a MERN Stack Application in AWS
## 1. Self Study Journey

**Overview**
In my pursuit of mastering full-stack development, I chose to build a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application deployed on AWS. This project was an opportunity to combine frontend and backend technologies with cloud deployment. By building this app, I aimed to enhance my proficiency in both MERN stack development and cloud services like AWS.
