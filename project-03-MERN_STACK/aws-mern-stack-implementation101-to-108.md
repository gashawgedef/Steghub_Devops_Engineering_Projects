MERN stack development is a full-stack web development approach using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, all based on JavaScript. MongoDB serves as the NoSQL database, while Express.js and Node.js handle the server-side logic, with React powering the dynamic user interface. This stack allows developers to build modern, scalable applications with a unified language, streamlining development across both frontend and backend. It is highly suitable for building single-page applications, offering efficiency through reusable React components, and enabling high performance with the asynchronous nature of Node.js.
