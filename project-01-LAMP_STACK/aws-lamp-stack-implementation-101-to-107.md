# Web stack(LAMP) Implimentation IN AWS

LAMP is an acronym that stands for four open-source software components commonly used to build dynamic websites and web applications:

- **Linux**: The operating system that provides the foundation for the server environment.
- **Apache HTTP Server**: The web server software that processes incoming requests from web browsers and delivers the requested content (HTML, images, etc.).
- **MySQL**: The relational database management system (RDBMS) that stores website data. MySQL offers a structured way to organize and manage website content, user information, application data, and more.
- **PHP (or Perl/Python)**: The server-side scripting language used to create dynamic web pages. PHP scripts can interact with the MySQL database to retrieve or manipulate data, generate customized content based on user input, and perform various server-side tasks. Perl and Python can also be used as alternatives in LAMP stacks, although PHP is the most common choice.
