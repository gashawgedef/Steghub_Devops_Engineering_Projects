Creating Linux partitions with `fdisk` involves the following steps. Be careful when using `fdisk`, as it can modify the partition table, potentially leading to data loss if not used properly.

### Steps to Create Linux Partitions Using `fdisk`:

**1. Open a Terminal:** Press Ctrl+Alt+T or open a terminal window in your Linux environment.

**2. List Disks:** Before starting, identify the disk where you want to create partitions by listing all available disks.

```
sudo fdisk -l
```
This will display information about your disks, e.g., `/dev/sda`, `/dev/sdb`.
