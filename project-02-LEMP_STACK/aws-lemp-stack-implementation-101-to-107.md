LEMP is an open-source web application stack used to develop web applications. The term LEMP is an acronym that represents **L** for the Linux Operating system, Nginx (pronounced as engine-x, hence the **E** in the acronym) web server, **M** for MySQL database, and **P** for PHP scripting language.
## The LEMP stack is a combination of four open-source technologies that are used in web development. These technologies include:

- **Linux:** The operating system that runs the web server.
- **Nginx:** The web server software that handles HTTP requests.
- **MySQL:** The relational database management system that stores the websiteâ€™s data.
- **PHP:** The programming language used to build dynamic web applications.

## Project 2: LEMP STACK Web Development
Project 2 covers similar concepts as Project 1 and help to cement your skill of deploying Web solutions using LA(E)MP stacks

**1. Launch instance in AWS Console**
The first step in implementing this project is launch an instance in AWS console

create an instance in the default region us-east-1 and enter instance name **LEMP STACK Web Server**
