LEMP is an open-source web application stack used to develop web applications. The term LEMP is an acronym that represents **L** for the Linux Operating system, Nginx (pronounced as engine-x, hence the **E** in the acronym) web server, **M** for MySQL database, and **P** for PHP scripting language.
