# Load Balancing Concepts and Differences between L4 Network Load Balancer and L7 Application Load Balancer

## Load Balancing Concepts

1. **Round Robin**: Distributes requests sequentially across a group of servers.
2. **Least Connections**: Directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
3. **IP Hash**: Uses the client's IP address to determine which server will handle the request.
4. **Weighted Round Robin**: Assigns a weight to each server based on capacity, distributing more requests to higher-capacity servers.
5. **Health Checks**: Continuously monitors servers' health and removes unresponsive servers from the pool.
6. **Session Persistence (Sticky Sessions)**: Ensures requests from a client during a session are directed to the same server.
7. **Geographic Load Balancing**: Directs traffic based on the geographic location of the client, optimizing for latency and compliance.

## L4 Network Load Balancer vs. L7 Application Load Balancer

Load balancers operate at different layers of the OSI network model, leading to distinct functionalities:

### L4 (Layer 4) Network Load Balancer:

- **Operation Level**: Operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model.
- **Mechanism**: Directs traffic based on IP addresses and TCP/UDP ports.
- **Speed and Performance**: Generally faster due to less inspection and fewer decisions needed, suitable for high-speed and low-latency requirements.
- **Protocol-Agnostic**: Can handle any protocol as it works below the application layer.

**Common Use Cases**:
- Useful for non-HTTP applications, such as SMTP, FTP, and other protocols, as well as for simple TCP/UDP load balancing.
- High-volume, low-complexity traffic (e.g., video streaming)
- Distributing traffic across web servers

### L7 (Layer 7) Application Load Balancer:

- **Operation Level**: Operates at the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model.
- **Mechanism**: Inspects HTTP/HTTPS headers and payloads to make more intelligent routing decisions based on content (e.g., URL, host, cookies).
- **Advanced Features**: Supports content-based routing, SSL termination, and Web Application Firewall (WAF) capabilities.
- **Protocol-Specific**: Designed primarily for HTTP/HTTPS traffic, providing advanced routing, redirection, and security features.

**Common Use Cases**: 
- Suitable for web applications, microservices architectures, and API gateway use cases where complex routing and content-based decisions are needed.
- Distributing traffic based on user logins or session data (e.g., e-commerce platforms)
- Offloading SSL encryption/decryption for web servers
- Advanced content routing based on URL paths

## Key Differences

1. **Layer of Operation**:
   - **L4**: Operates at the transport layer.
   - **L7**: Operates at the application layer.

2. **Routing Criteria**:
   - **L4**: Based on IP address and TCP/UDP port.
   - **L7**: Based on content of the request, such as HTTP headers, URLs, and cookies.

3. **Performance**:
   - **L4**: Faster, less resource-intensive, suited for high-speed, high-volume traffic.
   - **L7**: More resource-intensive due to deeper inspection, but provides more advanced routing capabilities.

4. **Protocol Support**:
   - **L4**: Protocol-agnostic.
   - **L7**: Protocol-specific (primarily HTTP/HTTPS).

5. **Use Cases**:
   - **L4**: Ideal for simple, high-performance load balancing across various protocols.
   - **L7**: Best for web applications requiring complex routing, security, and content-based decisions.

**Choosing the Right Load Balancer**
The choice depends on our specific needs:

- For high-performance, basic traffic distribution, L4 is a good option.
- For intelligent routing and application-aware management, L7 is the way to go.
In many cases, a combination of both L4 and L7 load balancers can be used for a well-rounded traffic management strategy.
> Understanding types of load balancer and their differences help us to choose the appropriate load balancer type based on our application's specific requirements and the level of control needed over traffic distribution.

2. **Understand what sticky session means and when it is used.**

## Apache mod_proxy_balancer Configuration `mod_proxy_balancer`

The `mod_proxy_balancer` module in Apache HTTP Server is used to configure load balancing between backend servers, which helps distribute incoming client requests to multiple servers to ensure availability and reliability.

### Load Balancer Configuration

- **BalancerMember:** Defines the backend servers (also called balancer members) in the load balancer pool.
```
  <Proxy balancer://mycluster>
      BalancerMember http://backend1.example.com
      BalancerMember http://backend2.example.com
  </Proxy>
  ProxyPass / balancer://mycluster/

```

**BalancerManager** : Provides a web-based interface to manage and monitor the load balancer

```
<Location /balancer-manager>
    SetHandler balancer-manager
    Require all granted
</Location>
```

### Sticky Sessions (Session Persistence)
Sticky sessions, also known as session persistence, ensure that a user's session is consistently handled by the same backend server. This is crucial for applications where session data is stored on the server, and accessing different servers for subsequent requests would disrupt the session state.

Sticky sessions can be configured using the stickysession parameter:
```
<Proxy balancer://mycluster>
    BalancerMember http://backend1.example.com
    BalancerMember http://backend2.example.com
    ProxySet stickysession=JSESSIONID
</Proxy>
ProxyPass / balancer://mycluster/ stickysession=JSESSIONID
```
In the above example, the `JSESSIONID` cookie is used to track the session, ensuring that all requests with the same session ID are routed to the same backend server.

## Load Balancing Methods

**byrequests**: Distributes requests evenly based on the number of requests.
```
ProxySet lbmethod=byrequests
```
**bytraffic**: Distributes requests based on the amount of traffic (bytes).
```
ProxySet lbmethod=bytraffic
```

**bybusyness**: Distributes requests based on the number of active requests
```
ProxySet lbmethod=bybusyness
```

## Failover and Recovery

`status=+H`: Marks a backend server as hot standby.

```
BalancerMember http://backend3.example.com status=+H
```
**retry**: Sets the time to wait before retrying a failed backend server.
```
ProxySet retry=60
```

## When to Use Sticky Sessions

Sticky sessions are particularly useful when:

- **Session Data**: The application stores session data on the server rather than in a shared storage or database.
- **Stateful Applications**: Applications that maintain state across multiple requests, such as shopping carts or user authentication systems.
- **Performance Considerations**: Avoiding the overhead of synchronizing session data across multiple servers.

> However, sticky sessions can reduce the effectiveness of load balancing and lead to uneven distribution of load. In such cases, it's often better to use a centralized session store or a shared caching solution like Redis or Memcached.
